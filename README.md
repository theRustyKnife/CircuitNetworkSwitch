#Description#
**Basically what the power switch does but with circuit network. It works literally like connecting and disconnecting two networks with wires, just automatically based on a circuit condition.**

-------------

#How to#
* Connect your two networks to the ends.
* Set your condition in the middle.
* Watch the magic

**You can also ask questions on the [forum](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=93&t=34406)!**

#Future plans#
* Make the cables invisible (impossible?)
